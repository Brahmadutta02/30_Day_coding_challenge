Day 1: Getting Started with Node.js 

30-Day Coding + Learning Journey

Today I began my journey into backend development by starting the "Getting Started with Node.js" module.

What I learned today:
✅ What Node.js is –
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript outside the browser, on the server-side, using the V8 engine (same engine Chrome uses).

✅ Why Node.js is important –
It's event-driven and non-blocking, meaning it can handle many tasks at once without waiting — especially useful for web servers and APIs.

✅ Setting up the environment –
Installed Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), verified versions, and prepared my development workspace with a code editor like VS Code.

✅ Created my first Node.js app:
I built a simple "Hello World" server that listens for web requests and responds with text.

## Running the Code

This directory contains example Node.js files that you can run:

### Simple Script
Run the basic JavaScript file:
```bash
node hello.js
```
Or use the npm script:
```bash
npm run hello
```

### HTTP Server
Start the Hello World server:
```bash
node server.js
```
Or use the npm script:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`. Open your browser and navigate to that URL to see the response. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server.

### Files in this directory:
- `hello.js` - Simple console output example
- `server.js` - Basic HTTP server example
- `package.json` - Node.js project configuration
